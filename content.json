Do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion. 作文： It has been discussed that whether【1】 the government should spend money on arts. In my opinion, the government should spend most of the tax revenue【2】 on public services, although arts are still important. 【1】That和whether都是主语从句的连接词，两个不可以同时使用，两个主要差别是意思上的差别，that就只是连接陈述句，而whether有是否的意思，这里去掉that 【2】题干里面说的是funds，并不一定就全部是指税收，这里是缩小了范围，改成funds Most of the financial income of the government should be spent on public services because the majority of the society can benefit from them. If the government invests in public facilities such as roads【3】, commuters【4】 will find it easier to travel to and from work【5】. It will also be more convenient for businessmen to transport products, thereby encouraging entrepreneurs to set up business, which creates more job opportunities. In contrast, spending money on arts may encourage artists and those who love arts, but most of the citizens may not be so interested. They may prefer job opportunities rather than arts. 【3】roads改成public transportation systems 【4】commuters改成people 【5】travel to and from work改成commute or travel Public services should get more money from the state, because they are important to the poor people.【6】 Students from remote villages may drop out from school without proper financial support【7】. The elders may not afford medical care without public hospitals which are funded by the state. There are so many aspects that the government should invest, such as agriculture, science, industry and military. Unless the government meets these demands, arts should not get much money from the state. 【6】这个论点和上文不是平行的部分。Poor people 明显比commuter 范围更广泛。改成in addition，more money should be allocated to compulsory education. 【7】后面加上which results in the deficiency of national quality. What’s more, public medical services cannot be ignored. Art is an important factor of our society. However, the government should not consider art as a priority. Arts can be funded by the private sector or the riches who love them. In conclusion, the government should spend more money on public services rather than arts. 评价与打分： Task response: 文章的论点比较散乱。在阐明自己立场的时候，论点需要个个平行并且不重合。而且论点开始之前，最好有明显的逻辑连接词来给读者提示。文章里面按人群分成commuter/businessman/poor people， 这三者很明显不平行且有重合。Businessman不需要通勤吗？通勤的人就不能有穷人吗？所以建议按照transportation system/education/medical health来划分。5-5.5 Coherence and cohesion：文章的逻辑性不强，也没有明显的逻辑链接。5-5.5 Grammatical range and accuracy：第一句就有明显的语法错误，很影响考官印象，文章表达比较普通，句式运用较为单一。5.5 Lexical resources：单词的运用没什么出彩的地方，继续加油。5-5.55-5.5","tags":[],"categories":[{"name":"写作-Writing","slug":"写作-Writing","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/写作-Writing/"},{"name":"作文批改","slug":"写作-Writing/作文批改","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/写作-Writing/作文批改/"}]},{"title":"全文翻译9：Pay Tax","date":"2018-03-03T04:32:34.000Z","path":"wiki/写作-Writing/《顾家北-剑11》全文翻译/文翻译9：Pay-Tax/","text":"","tags":[],"categories":[{"name":"写作-Writing","slug":"写作-Writing","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/写作-Writing/"},{"name":"《顾家北-剑11》全文翻译","slug":"写作-Writing/《顾家北-剑11》全文翻译","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/写作-Writing/《顾家北-剑11》全文翻译/"}]},{"title":"全文翻译8：Distance Education v.s.
